# README for Evidently Data Drift Analysis

This README provides instructions on how to display HTML reports generated by Evidently's analysis using Jupyter Notebook (`evidently.ipynb`) and Streamlit (`evidently_st.py`). It also covers how to utilize a pre-generated JSON file (`data_drift_report.json`) to run the Streamlit app when the Jupyter Notebook is not available.

## 1. Generating and Viewing HTML Reports from `evidently.ipynb`

### Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
- Evidently library installed. You can install it using pip:
  ```
  pip install evidently
  ```

### Steps
1. Open the `evidently.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run all the cells in the notebook. Ensure your dataset is properly loaded and configured in the notebook.
3. The notebook will generate an HTML report as output. This report visualizes the data drift or any other analysis performed in the notebook.
4. To view the generated HTML report, simply open the HTML file in a web browser.

## 2. Running `evidently_st.py` Using Streamlit

### Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Streamlit installed. You can install it using pip:
  ```
  pip install streamlit
  ```
- Evidently library installed.

### Steps
1. Ensure `data_drift_report.json` is present in the same directory as `evidently_st.py`. This JSON file can be the output from `evidently.ipynb` or a pre-generated file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `evidently_st.py`.
4. Run the following command:
   ```
   streamlit run evidently_st.py
   ```
5. Streamlit will start a local web server and open the report in your default web browser.

### Using `data_drift_report.json` as Input
- `evidently_st.py` is configured to use `data_drift_report.json` as input if the notebook is not available or you prefer to use pre-generated data. Simply ensure the JSON file is in the same directory as the script.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the notebook or Streamlit app.
- For best performance, use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
